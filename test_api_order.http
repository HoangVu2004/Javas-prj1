### Create an Order (Checkout)
# This request simulates the checkout process.
# The controller is currently set up to default to user ID 1 if no authentication is provided,
# which is useful for testing without needing a valid JWT token.


POST http://localhost:8084/api/orders/checkout
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "address": "123 Main St, Anytown, USA",
  "phone": "555-123-4567",
  "paymentMethod": "Credit Card"
}

### Get Order History for a User
# This request retrieves all orders for the currently authenticated user.
# NOTE: Unlike the checkout endpoint, this one requires authentication.
# You will need to replace {{jwt_token}} with a valid token obtained from logging in.

GET http://localhost:8080/api/orders
Authorization: Bearer {{jwt_token}}
